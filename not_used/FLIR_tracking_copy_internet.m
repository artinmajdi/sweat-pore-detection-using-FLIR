% Detect moving objects, and track them across video frames.

%% Detect Objects
% The |detectObjects| function returns the centroids and the bounding boxes
% of the detected objects. It also returns the binary mask, which has the 
% same size as the input frame. Pixels with a value of 1 correspond to the
% foreground, and pixels with a value of 0 correspond to the background.   
%
% The function performs motion segmentation using the foreground detector. 
% It then performs morphological operations on the resulting binary mask to
% remove noisy pixels and to fill the holes in the remaining blobs.  


        % Detect foreground.
        mask = detector.step(frame);
        
        % Apply morphological operations to remove noise and fill in holes.
        mask = imopen(mask, strel('rectangle', [15,15]));
%         mask = imclose(mask, strel('rectangle', [15, 15])); 
         mask = imclose(mask, strel('rectangle', [15, 15])); 
        mask = imfill(mask, 'holes');
        
        % Perform blob analysis to find connected components.
        [~, centroids, bboxes] = blobAnalyser.step(mask);
%     end

%% Predict New Locations of Existing Tracks
% Use the Kalman filter to predict the centroid of each track in the
% current frame, and update its bounding box accordingly.

        for i = 1:length(tracks)
            bbox = tracks(i).bbox;
            
            % Predict the current location of the track.
            predictedCentroid = predict(tracks(i).kalmanFilter);
            
            % Shift the bounding box so that its center is at 
            % the predicted location.
            predictedCentroid = int32(predictedCentroid) - bbox(3:4) / 2;
            tracks(i).bbox = [predictedCentroid, bbox(3:4)];
        end
%     end

%% Assign Detections to Tracks
% Assigning object detections in the current frame to existing tracks is
% done by minimizing cost. The cost is defined as the negative
% log-likelihood of a detection corresponding to a track.  
%
% The algorithm involves two steps: 
%
% Step 1: Compute the cost of assigning every detection to each track using
% the |distance| method of the |vision.KalmanFilter| System object. The 
% cost takes into account the Euclidean distance between the predicted
% centroid of the track and the centroid of the detection. It also includes
% the confidence of the prediction, which is maintained by the Kalman
% filter. The results are stored in an MxN matrix, where M is the number of
% tracks, and N is the number of detections.   
%
% Step 2: Solve the assignment problem represented by the cost matrix using
% the |assignDetectionsToTracks| function. The function takes the cost 
% matrix and the cost of not assigning any detections to a track.  
%
% The value for the cost of not assigning a detection to a track depends on
% the range of values returned by the |distance| method of the 
% |vision.KalmanFilter|. This value must be tuned experimentally. Setting 
% it too low increases the likelihood of creating a new track, and may
% result in track fragmentation. Setting it too high may result in a single 
% track corresponding to a series of separate moving objects.   
%
% The |assignDetectionsToTracks| function uses the Munkres' version of the
% Hungarian algorithm to compute an assignment which minimizes the total
% cost. It returns an M x 2 matrix containing the corresponding indices of
% assigned tracks and detections in its two columns. It also returns the
% indices of tracks and detections that remained unassigned. 

        
        nTracks = length(tracks);
        nDetections = size(centroids, 1);
        
        % Compute the cost of assigning each detection to each track.
        cost = zeros(nTracks, nDetections);
        for i = 1:nTracks
            cost(i, :) = distance(tracks(i).kalmanFilter, centroids);
        end
        
        % Solve the assignment problem.
        costOfNonAssignment = 50;
        [assignments, unassignedTracks, unassignedDetections] = ...
            assignDetectionsToTracks(cost, costOfNonAssignment);
%     end

%% Update Assigned Tracks
% The |updateAssignedTracks| function updates each assigned track with the
% corresponding detection. It calls the |correct| method of
% |vision.KalmanFilter| to correct the location estimate. Next, it stores
% the new bounding box, and increases the age of the track and the total
% visible count by 1. Finally, the function sets the invisible count to 0. 

  
        numAssignedTracks = size(assignments, 1);
        for i = 1:numAssignedTracks
            trackIdx = assignments(i, 1);

            centroid = centroids(detectionIdx, :);
            bbox = bboxes(detectionIdx, :);
            
            tracks(trackIdx).trails{end+1} = centroid;
            % Correct the estimate of the object's location
            % using the new detection.

            tracks(trackIdx).trails_corrected{end+1} = c2;
            
            % Replace predicted bounding box with detected
            % bounding box.
     
            if length( tracks(trackIdx).trails) > 30
                tracks(trackIdx).trails(1) = [];
            end
            if length( tracks(trackIdx).trails_corrected) > 30
                tracks(trackIdx).trails_corrected(1) = [];
            end
            tracks(trackIdx).bbox = bbox;
            
            % Update track's age.
            tracks(trackIdx).age = tracks(trackIdx).age + 1;

                tracks(trackIdx).totalVisibleCount + 1;

%% Update Unassigned Tracks
% Mark each unassigned track as invisible, and increase its age by 1.

        for i = 1:length(unassignedTracks)
            ind = unassignedTracks(i);
            tracks(ind).age = tracks(ind).age + 1;
      
            c2 = predict(tracks(ind).kalmanFilter);
            
            tracks(ind).trails_corrected{end+1} = c2;
            
            % Replace predicted bounding box with detected
            % bounding box.

%% Delete Lost Tracks
% The |deleteLostTracks| function deletes tracks that have been invisible
% for too many consecutive frames. It also deletes recently created tracks
% that have been invisible for too many frames overall. 

%         if isempty(tracks)

%         end

        ageThreshold = 30;
        
        % Compute the fraction of the track's age for which it was visible.
        ages = [tracks(:).age];
        totalVisibleCounts = [tracks(:).totalVisibleCount];
        visibility = totalVisibleCounts ./ ages;
        
        % Find the indices of 'lost' tracks.
        lostInds = (ages < ageThreshold & visibility < 0.6) | ...
            [tracks(:).consecutiveInvisibleCount] >= invisibleForTooLong;
        
        % Delete lost tracks.
        tracks = tracks(~lostInds);
    

%% Create New Tracks
